## components
  - these are components that are used through different views / containers such as buttons or layouts
  - this would directly correspond with what we already have in our component directory
  - for groups of components eg layouts we would have a folder with each individual layout type as a single file below it
## containers
  - this would be a folder for each container (somewhat like reimbursements but each would be split to it's own)
  - each container is the main goo of a page / subpage
  - it is connected to state
## views
  - not connected to state
  - this is the view that routes to differnt containers
## store
  - as we currently have it
  - additional we can add types here in a `modelTypes` file
